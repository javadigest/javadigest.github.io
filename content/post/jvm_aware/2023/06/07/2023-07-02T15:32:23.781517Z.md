description: "I have been using AWS services at my workplace and on my side projects for several years. While the AWS console provides a quick way to jumpstart, it does not entirely integrate with the typical software development lifecycle. At my workplace, we have been using Terraform to provision the infrastructure, but for a side project or working on a proof of concept, I am usually looking for a quicker solution without much overhead."
