description: "Vertical and Horizontal scaling are two approaches to deal with increased load on the system. While Vertical scaling involves adding more resources such as CPU, RAM, or storage to an existing machine, horizontal scaling involves adding more devices to the overall platform. While both approaches have their advantages, there are situations where vertical scaling is not a suitable option. In the last couple of years, I had this discussion multiple times with my colleagues and clients where they are not in favor of increasing infrastructure footprint and are more inclined towards expanding the overall system capacity by adding more resources like CPU, memory, etc."
