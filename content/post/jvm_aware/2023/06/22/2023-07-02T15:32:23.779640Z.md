description: "While GitHub has been the primary choice for an SCM tool for many of us, with the integration of various CI tools and ready-made actions, it is growing as an end-to-end solution for complete DevOps practices. At my workplace, we are now using GitLab for various purposes(migrated from Bitbucket and TeamCity), and it has been a smooth migration so far. But I wanted to explore similar features in GitHub as I was already familiar with the interface and hosting almost all of my side projects there."
